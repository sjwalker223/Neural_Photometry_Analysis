# Neural_Photometry_Analysis
 Analysis pipeline for recordings of population neural activity acquired using fiber photometry.
 
 The codes in this directory allow the user to analyze neural activity recordings from individual and pooled trials, to extract insights about the relationship between external events and activity in specific neuron populations.

The code is grouped into two types, with separate directories. One is for analyzing "short trials" - i.e. recordings of up to a few hours, which may have events of interest annotated based on simultaneously acquired video data. The second is for analyzing "long trials" - i.e. recordings over many hours or days. Long trials may also have simultaneously acquired behavioral data from a "FED3" device, which measures food-seeking and food retrieval behaviors.

For more information on these pipelines, see readmes within each folder.
